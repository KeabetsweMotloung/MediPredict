# MediPredict
This repository contains the implementation of a medical cost prediction model using linear regression. The goal of this project is to predict the medical expenses of individuals based on various demographic and lifestyle factors. Additionally, a user-friendly interface is provided to input personal information and obtain cost predictions along with potential cost-saving suggestions.

## Project Overview
Predicting medical costs is a crucial task in the healthcare and insurance industries. Accurate predictions can help in planning, budgeting, and providing better financial advice to patients. This project leverages the Medical Cost Personal Datasets from Kaggle to build a linear regression model that predicts medical costs based on factors such as age, BMI, smoking status, number of children, and region.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Medical Cost Personal Datasets from Kaggle. It includes the following features:

Age: Age of the individual
Sex: Gender of the individual
BMI: Body Mass Index of the individual
Children: Number of children/dependents
Smoker: Smoking status of the individual (yes/no)
Region: Residential region of the individual
Charges: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance
Features
Data Exploration and Preparation: Detailed exploration of the dataset to understand the relationships between variables and the target (medical costs).
Model Development: Building and training a linear regression model to predict medical costs based on input features.
User Interface: A user-friendly web application where users can input their personal information and receive predicted medical costs.
Cost-Saving Suggestions: Providing users with potential cost-saving alternatives based on their predicted medical costs and input variables.
Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

python app.py
Usage
Data Preparation:

## Clean and preprocess the dataset.
Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.
Model Training:

## Train the linear regression model using the cleaned dataset.
Evaluate model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
User Interface:

Users can input their age, BMI, smoking status, number of children, and region.
The application predicts the medical costs based on the input data.
Additional suggestions for cost-saving alternatives are provided.
Results
The linear regression model demonstrates the ability to predict medical costs with reasonable accuracy.
The web interface allows for easy and intuitive interaction with the model, making it accessible for users to obtain predictions and insights.
